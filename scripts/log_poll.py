"""Poll the Forge Line live proxy and append one standardized telemetry record.

Output: data/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl (UTC date), one JSON object per line, one line
per successful poll. Failed polls are never logged as empty records -- a gap
in the 5-minute cadence means that poll failed or was skipped.

Record format: forge-line.telemetry/v1 (see SCHEMA.md).

Endpoint registry: data/vehicles/registry.json is a persistent per-vehicle
inventory, updated every successful poll. Each bus is a managed endpoint:
keyed by vehicle_id, with identity, route assignment, last check-in state,
and check-in history counters. Vehicles absent from a poll keep their record
and are marked "quiet" -- the inventory is cumulative, like any endpoint
manager. This registry (plus the JSONL check-in history) is the foundation
for empirical point-to-point timing.
